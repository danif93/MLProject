# MLProject
Neural network for handwritten digits recognition; inspiration provided by http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html


In order to increase isolation and substitulability, the whole project is partitioned in packages.

Particular mentions are needed for the two launch scripts, _'launch.ipynb'_ is extremely helpful for users that are familiar with jupyter notebook; otherwise just make use of 'launch.py'.

The main workload is performed by the optimisation functions contained in _'optimisation\_functions.py'_: they are in charge of starting the learning process taking as input a neural network already initialised (_'neural\_network.py'_).

For understanding purposes, i suggest starting to read _'launch.py'_ in order to get familiar with the structure model i've conceived.
